Certainly, here are some additional changes to the code:

1. Improved readability by renaming variables for clarity.
2. Utilized list comprehension for filtering words.
3. Adjusted the output format for better presentation.

```python
import re
from collections import Counter
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

nltk.download('stopwords')

def process_text(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read().lower()  
    
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text)
    
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    filtered_words = [w for w in words if w not in stop_words]
    
    word_freq = Counter(filtered_words)
    
    return word_freq

def print_frequency_table(word_freq):
    print("Word\t\tFrequency")
    print("-----------------------")
    for word, freq in word_freq.items():
        print(f"{word.capitalize().ljust(15)}\t{freq}")  # Capitalized the first letter of each word

file_path = './paragraphs.txt'

word_freq = process_text(file_path)

print_frequency_table(word_freq)
```
